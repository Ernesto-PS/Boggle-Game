# Boggle-Game

**Overview**

This project involves creating a randomly generated Boggle board where players have three minutes to find as many valid words as possible. The goal is to implement game mechanics that adhere to the official Boggle rules, including word formation constraints and scoring.  

**Game Rules**

* The board is randomly generated.  
* Words must be at least three letters long.  
* Letters must be adjoining in sequence (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in any direction).  
* A letter cube cannot be used more than once in a single word.  
* Players submit words, and their scores are calculated accordingly.

**How to Run**

1. Compile the File with: gcc -o boggle boggle5.c
2. Execute the file with: ./boggle5
